# SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS

To help you create a good README for your GitHub project, I'll need to understand the context and content of your project. I'll start by reviewing the provided file, NLP_PROJECT.ipynb, to gather relevant information.

Let's start by loading and inspecting the contents of the notebook.


Analyzed

python
Always show details

Copy code
import nbformat

# Load the Jupyter notebook
notebook_path = '/mnt/data/NLP_PROJECT.ipynb'
with open(notebook_path) as f:
    nlp_notebook = nbformat.read(f, as_version=4)

# Extracting basic information from the notebook
basic_info = {
    "cells": len(nlp_notebook['cells']),
    "cell_types": set(cell.cell_type for cell in nlp_notebook['cells'])
}

basic_info
Result
{'cells': 52, 'cell_types': {'code', 'markdown'}}
The notebook contains 52 cells with a mix of code and markdown cells. To proceed, I will extract some of the markdown content to understand the project better and identify the key components needed for the README.

Let's extract the markdown cells. ​​

# Extracting markdown cells
markdown_cells = [cell['source'] for cell in nlp_notebook['cells'] if cell.cell_type == 'markdown']

# Display the first few markdown cells to get an overview of the project
markdown_snippets = markdown_cells[:5]

Based on the extracted markdown content, here's an outline for the README file for your GitHub project:

Sentiment Analysis Project

Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It involves analyzing and classifying the sentiment of restaurant reviews.

Author
Dhiman Saha

Environment
The project is developed and tested in Google Colab.

Libraries Used
NumPy (np): For numerical operations.
Pandas (pd): For handling datasets.
Scikit-learn:
train_test_split: To train and split the data.
TfidfVectorizer: To create the TF-IDF vectors.
Support Vector Classifier (SVC): For classification.
make_pipeline: For creating pipelines.
MultinomialNB: For Naive Bayes classification.
Project Structure
Importing Libraries: Initial setup and importing necessary libraries.
Reading Data: Loading and preparing the dataset (job_postings_raw.dat).
Data Analysis: Identifying patterns and insights in the data.
Feature Engineering: Creating TF-IDF vectors.
Model Training: Training models using SVC and Naive Bayes classifiers.
Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models.
How to Run
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/dscoder001/SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS.git
Open the project in Google Colab by clicking the "Open In Colab" badge above.
Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to reproduce the results.
Results
Description of results (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) obtained from the models.
Visualizations and insights derived from the data analysis.
